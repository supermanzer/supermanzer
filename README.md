# Hi, I'm Ryan Manzer

I do stuff...also things.

I generally enjoy building full-stack containerized applications of various sorts. I also enjoy making relatively simple productivity appllications and have an interest in facilitating the rapid access of publicly available scientific data for analyses and visualization.

- I'm currently learning the Vue.js (and Nuxt.js) frameworks for developing reactive front-end applications. I've been tinkering with Angular a bit too but I'm pretty stoked about Vue.

- I'm looking to collaborate on some Python applications for scientists and researchers. I've based what little work I've done in that field on my own struggles as a grad student but it would be nice to work with others who are still active in the field.

- I really enjoy using the Python language and would be excited to work on Python projects of various sorts.
